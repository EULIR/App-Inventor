App Inventor for Android is an open-source web application originally provided by Google, and now maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This website is however extremely friendly to new computer programming learners. It is a good choice to develop Android apps if JavaScript or Kotlin is not availbale.
